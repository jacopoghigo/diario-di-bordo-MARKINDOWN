\section{Incidence by Type of Worker}

\caption{Non-compete clauses by worker type}
\label{fig:ncc_by_worker_type}
\end{figure}

 Considering the countries with the larger mismatch between worker and firm's incidence, for \textbf{Japan}, \textbf{Korea}, \textbf{New Zealand}, and \textbf{Poland} it seems that the mismatch is mainly driven by differences in the worker category: ``Other'' (i.e. receptionist, clerk, secretary, waiter, security guard, electrician, plant operator, cleaner, etc.). For \textbf{France} and \textbf{Switzerland}, instead, the mismatch is proportional across types of workers.


\section{Validity of Noncompete clauses}




We want to explore whether there is some interesting correlation between the mismatch betweeen worker and employer incidence values, and the validity of the Noncompete clauses reported. By exploiting an elaboration from OECD on the legislative framework of the countries of our dataset, we seek to create one dummy variable for each country, indicating whether the clause is legal or not(or whether it is ambiguous). The first step is to lie down, if available, relevant criteria that can be cross-checked within out dataset, in order to create such dummies. In the following list we report, for each country, the information that we have on the legal framework, and we proposed the parameters that we can use to create the dummies.

\subsection{Literature}

\cite{starr_behavioral_2020} study how unenforceable contractual provisions may affect behaviour. Even in states that
do not enforce noncompetes, employees who agree to be bound by such provisions show generally
lower mobility levels and evince redirection toward noncompetitors. Decomposing mobility into job offer generation and acceptance, the study detected no evidence of differences in job search, recruitment, or offer activity associated with non-competes. Rather, the effect occurs at the job offer acceptance stage—workers turn down opportunities they otherwise would have accepted.

\cite{prescott_subjective_2024} show that an information treatment that roughly simulates aneducational campaign can cause employees to update their beliefs aboutenforceability—especially when noncompetes are actually unenforceable.After receiving information, employees with an unenforceable noncom-pete report that their noncompete would be less of a factor in choosingwhether to accept employment with a competitor than they do when theymistakenly believe ex ante that their noncompete is enforceable. However,employees as a group do not fully adjust their mobility intentions (that is,they do not report that their noncompete would no longer matter). In fact,a nontrivial fraction of employees who see their noncompete as unenforce-able and who view a lawsuit as unlikely continue to consider their non-compete to be a factor in deciding whether to take a job offer at a compet-itor. This result suggests that moral, reputational, and perhaps financialcosts remain for violating even entirely unenforceable contract provisions.

\cite{boeri_non-compete_2023} find that unenforceable clauses, i.e. clauses that are more likely to be used
just to deter workers from moving and not to protect business interests, go hand-in-hand with lower
wages compared to likely enforceable ones. On the opposite, they are not associated to higher or lower
training opportunities.

1. Statute of general applicability & No federal statute regulates the use of non-compete clauses in Canada (two out of the ten Canadian provinces regulate the use of non-compete clauses by law). \\
\hline
2. Role of collective agreements & Preliminary evidence indicates that some collective agreements may play a role in regulating the use of non-compete clauses at the firm level. \\
\hline
3. Employer's protectable interest & A non-compete clause is void and unenforceable, unless the employer has a "real proprietary interest" (such as trade secrets, confidential information, and customer lists). \\
\hline
4. Compensation & Compensation is not formally required. \\
\hline
5. Change in terms/continued employment sufficient consideration & There must be a new "fresh mutual consideration". \\
\hline
6. Plaintiff burden of proof & Non-compete must be reasonable \\
\hline
7. Modification or blue pencil & Courts generally do not amend or modify an ambiguous or overly broad non-compete; however, courts have sometimes accepted that "blue-pencil" severance may be applied in limited circumstances. \\
\hline
8. Enforceability in case of dismissal & Courts have ruled that when an employer commits a regulatory breach of an employment contract (e.g. a wrongful dismissal), the employee will be released from the obligations of a non-compete clause. \\
\hline
9. Sanctions & (Except for Ontario) there are no explicit penalties, fines or other sanctions for employers using overly broad or unenforceable agreements. \\

\hline
1. Statute of general applicability & Article 65, \S 1, and Article 86, \S 1, Employment Contracts Act. Maximum duration 12 months. \\
\hline
2. Role of collective agreements & The Belgian Employment Contracts Act expressly refers collective bargaining agreements to regulate non-compete clauses under some circumstances (e.g., if the salary is between Euro 43,106 and 86,212, a non-compete is valid only for those occupations whose collective agreement, signed at joint committee level, regulates the use of non-compete clauses). However, only a few joint committees have stipulated a collective agreement regulating non-compete clauses. \\
\hline
3. Employer's protectable interest & The covenant must cover similar activities (in terms of the type of business, as well as based on the employee's occupation and tasks performed). By exploiting special knowledge, peculiar to, and acquired in that enterprise, there must be a possibility that the enterprise is harmed. \\
\hline
4. Compensation & Minimum compensation 50\% of gross salary. \\
\hline
5. Change in terms/continued employment sufficient consideration & No specified circumstances, but employees need to agree to sign the agreement. \\
\hline
6. Plaintiff burden of proof & Non-compete must be reasonable, within certain boundaries set by the regulatory framework (including wage thresholds). \\
\hline
7. Modification or blue pencil & Blue pencil or modification not allowed. \\
\hline
8. Enforceability in case of dismissal & Article 65, \S 2 of the Employment Contracts Act provides that a non-compete is unenforceable if the contract is terminated either during the first six months from the commencement of the employment contract, after such period, by the employer without urgent cause on the part of the employee, or by the employee due to urgent cause on the part of the employer. \\
\hline
9. Sanctions & Employers are not subject to sanctions if they use unenforceable non-compete clauses \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\cite{hendrickx_non-compete_2022} established that noncompete shall be deemed non-existent when the annual salary does not exceed 36,201 Euro. If the salary is included between 36,201 and 72,402, the clause is valid only if the post is determined by a collective bargaining agreement. 
The clause must be included in a written document. 
It must relate to similar activities: it cannot contain only wordings such as: ``prohibition on entering the service of a competitor''. 
The NCA must be geographically limtied to the places where the employee can actually compete with the employer, given the nature of the business and its radius. It must NOT extend beyond national territory. 
The NCA cannot last longer than 12 months. 
The NCA must contain a compensation to the employee. The minimum amount of this indemntity is equal to half of the worker's gross salary corresponding to the period of application of the noncompete clause. 
Finally, \cite{hendrickx_non-compete_2022} specifies that for some white collar workers, it is possible to deviate form the above mentioned conditions. The two following conditions must hold:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The company must have an international field of activity or significant economic, technical or financial interests in international amrkets; or
    \item It must have its own research department. 
\end{itemize}

Basically, if such employees can acquire specific knowledge or skills, the NCA can restrain the worker from being employed also outside the national territory, and for longer than 12 months. 

Based on this information, I could create a dummy for Belgium == 1 if:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Duration $\leq$ 12 months
    \item Compensation present
    \item The NCC is limited to the a competing firm, taking into account sector and location

\hline
7. Modification or blue pencil & Courts cannot reduce the scope of the non-compete unless the employee agrees to it. \\
\hline
8. Enforceability in case of dismissal & According to Article 75 of the Commercial Code, in case of dismissal without prior notice, the non-compete is unenforceable if the party who terminates the contract declares within one month upon termination that they want to be released. If the employee terminates the contract, she remains bound by the non-competition clause subject to a mutually agreed termination. If the employer terminates the employment contract, the employee may be released from the non-competition clause, provided that the termination was not due to a significant personal reason, or the employer agrees to pay compensation in the amount of the full contractual remuneration for the duration of the non-competition clause. \\
\hline
9. Sanctions & Employers are not subject to sanctions if they use unenforceable non-compete clauses. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

According to \cite{magotsch_chapter_2018} (further evidence can be found here \cite{maron_10_2022}), the law in relation to noncompetition clauses is regulated by the Commercial Code, which sets out detailed requirements for the validity of NCAs.
NCAs must be in written form and signed by both parties. The clause must make provision for a compensation payment in relation to the whole length of a noncompete, regardless of the extent of its application to the branch or business of the employer. Interestingly,  If the compensation payment as stipulated in the contract does not meet the minimum statutory requirements, the
employee has a choice whether or not to comply with the non-competition clause. When the employee chooses not to comply, the clause is not enforceable by the
employer. In case the employee decides to comply, the employer must pay the
compensation payment as stipulated. 
the employee should receive a monthly payment of at least half of his former gross earnings. 
A non-competition clause can only have effect to protect the legitimate interests of
the employer. The courts have developed the following criteria from this
requirement:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Sector and geographical area: Case law has shown that a non-competition clause
that is extended beyond the sector of the employer is too broad, as is a worldwide
clause. In such cases the courts will adjust the clause. The adjusted clause will
still be enforceable and the employer will therefore still have to pay the compensation payment
\item Length of non-competition clause: Non-competition clauses can only be binding
for a period of up to 2 years. If a longer period has been agreed between the
parties, after 2 years the employee will have the choice of continuing to comply
with the non-competition clause and receiving a compensation payment, or
ceasing to comply and entering into competition.
\end{itemize}

\cite{ueda_restrictions_2018} posits that courts seem to understand that a standard reasonable term of restrictive covenants is two years or shorter. 
In Japan, courts have enforced covenants with no geographical limitation at all, as long as other elements remained within a reasonable range. 
As a general rule, Japanese contract law does not require contracting parties to supply any consideration to enforce their promise, and courts seem to regard compensatory measures element as a flexible notion.

1. Statute of general applicability & Code of Obligations (Article 340 and following) regulates non-compete clauses. Maximum duration is 3 years. \\
\hline
2. Role of collective agreements & A preliminary analysis of some collective agreements indicates that they contain rules on the prohibition of competition; however, they refer in general to the rules of the Code of Obligations. \\
\hline
3. Employer's protectable interest & An employee can sign a written agreement whereby they refrain from competing as long as the employment relationship allows the employee to gain knowledge about employer's clients, methods of production and trade secrets and such knowledge might cause the employer substantial harm. \\
\hline
4. Compensation & Courts apply a reasonableness test. \\
\hline
5. Change in terms/continued employment sufficient consideration & No specified circumstances, but employees need to agree to sign the agreement \\
\hline
6. Plaintiff burden of proof & Non-compete must be reasonable, within certain boundaries set by the regulatory framework \\
\hline
7. Modification or blue pencil & Following Article 340a of the Code of Obligations, courts tend to limit the scope of the restriction when the agreement is overbroad. \\
\hline
8. Enforceability in case of dismissal & At termination, employers can unilaterally release employees; however, when obligations are bilateral (e.g., the employee is entitled to receive a compensation) the parties must agree to the release, unless the written agreement provide otherwise. Moreover, Article 340c provides that the restriction on competition is extinguished once the employer demonstrably no longer has a substantial interest in its continuation", as well as when the employer terminates the employment relationship without good cause or if the employee terminates the employment relationship with good cause. \\
\hline
9. Sanctions & Employers are not subject to sanctions if they use unenforceable non-compete clauses \\

Based on this information, I could create a dummy for Switzerland == 1 if:
\begin{itemize}
    
    \item Maximum duration: 36 months

\begin{tabular}{|p{0.35\textwidth}|p{0.6\textwidth}|}
\hline
\textbf{Dimension/Question} & \textbf{Short answer} \\
\hline
1. Statute of general applicability & Common law courts have assessed the reasonableness of non-compete clauses agreements. \\
\hline
2. Role of collective agreements & There is no indication of collective agreements playing a role in regulating non-compete clauses. \\
\hline
3. Employer's protectable interest & The covenant must protect legitimate employers' interests such as a customer base and trade secrets. \\
\hline
4. Compensation & For a new employee, the offer of employment (plus salary and benefits) is deemed sufficient consideration for entering a non-compete. \\
\hline
5. Change in terms/continued employment sufficient consideration & For existing employees, non-compete clauses require additional consideration, such as a pay rise or new benefits, and continued employment is not sufficient. \\
\hline
6. Plaintiff burden of proof & Non-compete must be reasonable \\
\hline
7. Modification or blue pencil & Courts render non-compete clauses void when they are unreasonable and do not rewrite the covenant to render it enforceable. However, courts apply the blue pencil test when the unenforceable provision of the clause can be removed without the need for adding to or modifying the wording. \\
\hline
8. Enforceability in case of dismissal & The enforceability of a non-compete is not linked to the reason for the termination of the employment relationship. The circumstances of the dismissal might play a role in how courts grant the remedies in the specific case (e.g., if the employee is unfairly dismissed, courts might be less willing to grant an injunctive relief) \\
\hline
9. Sanctions & Employers are not subject to sanctions if they use unenforceable non-compete clauses \\

\subsubsection*{Conclusions}

For \textbf{Canada}, \textbf{Korea} and \textbf{New Zealand}, I cannot apply any restriction because I could not define any valid criterion for legality. For \textbf{France}, by not considering those clauses for which compensation is not required, the percentage of workers affected becomes 23\%, well below employers. For \textbf{Poland} and \textbf{Japan}, if I remove the clauses that do not provide compensation, I obtain a perfect match between workers and employers. 
However, applying the same criteria to all the 14 countries, creates an important mismatch in all those countries where worker and firms were previously aligned.
