	abstract = {Our current labor markets show that knowledge, innovation and talent  are key components. If a “knowledge-driven economy” exists, either as  reality or ambition, it is at least surrounded by globalization, increasing  competitive pressure, technological developments and the need for constant  innovation. But it would also appear that, in this context, employers and  employees find their added value in the know—how they contribute and  generate. Furthermore, from an entrepreneurial perspective, the importance  of protecting the knowledge, or “know—how,” is increasing, as is the  importance of attracting and retaining talented colleagues or collaborators.  This context does not leave the law of labor unaffected. Many employers are  looking for ways to retain talented employees or to prevent them from taking  away the knowledge they have brought into the enterprise to other businesses  or exploiting it themselves. An employer has an interest in ensuring that the  knowledge, innovation strategies as well as their talented staff do not  disappear and then transfer that knowledge to a competing business. At the  same time, the labor market may also be seen as open market place, where  work and labor is, in principle, free. This would give employees a foundation  for engaging themselves in different activities, either simultaneously or  consecutively, on the labor market.  Legal systems will respond differently to this context and non-compete  obligations, the subject of this contribution, have to be seen from this wider  perspective. This contribution looks into the labor law system of Belgium.},

Methods Using a sample of men and women drawn from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997, a series of wage models are estimated that account for both the timing and frequency of job changes over the first decade of the working career as well as for complex interactions between job mobility, actual work experience, and job tenure. Results The wage estimates indicate that workers who demonstrate moderate job-changing in the first 2 years after labor market entry but then taper their mobility thereafter actually raise their log-wage path above that of either immobile workers or persistent job changers. Conclusion This finding is significant because previous studies have often found a negative relationship between cumulative job mobility and wages, with immobile workers typically earning the highest wages. The results from this study show that a poor job match at the start of the career need not permanently lower a worker's wage profile but can be more than made up for through strategic early-career job mobility.},

First, we propose two new residual diagnostic tests of the assumption that mobility is exogenous to unmodeled determinants of earnings. Both tests reject exogenous mobility. We relax exogenous mobility by modeling the matched data as an evolving bipartite graph using a Bayesian latent-type framework. Our results suggest that allowing endogenous mobility increases the variation in earnings explained by individual heterogeneity and reduces the proportion due to employer and match effects. To assess external validity, we match our estimates of the wage components to out-of-sample estimates of revenue per worker. The mobility-bias corrected estimates attribute much more of the variation in revenue per worker to variation in match quality and worker quality than the uncorrected estimates.},

This paper explores the presence of such arrangements in a rigid labour market, with strict employment protection regulations by OECD standards and where all employees are, at least on paper, subject to collective bargaining. Based on a representative survey of employees in the private sector, an exam of collective agreements and case law, we find that in Italy i) collective agreements play no role in regulating the use of NCCs while the law specifies only the formal requirements, ii) about 16\% of private sector employees are currently bound by a NCC, iii) NCCs are relatively frequent among low educated employees in manual and elementary low paid occupations having no access to any type of confidential information, and iv) in addition to NCCs, a number of other arrangements limit the post-employment activity of workers. Many of the NCCs do not comply with the minimum requirements established by law and yet workers do not consider them as unenforceable and appear to behave as they were effective. Even when NCCs are unenforceable they appear to negatively affect wages when they are introduced without changing the tasks of the workers involved. Normative implications are discussed in the last section of the paper.},

We demonstrate that employees tend to believe that even clearly unenforceable noncompetes are enforceable, including their own. We provide evidence for both supply- and demand-side stories that explain employees’ persistently inaccurate beliefs. Moreover, we show that believing that unenforceable noncompetes are enforceable likely causes employees to forgo better job opportunities and to perceive that their employer is more likely to sue them if they choose to compete. Finally, we use an information experiment to inform employees about the enforceability of their noncompete. While this information matters for employees’ beliefs and prospective behavior, it does not appear to eliminate an unenforceable noncompete as a factor in the decision to take a new job. We conclude with implications for the policy debate regarding the enforceability of noncompetes.},

We explore this question in the context of employment noncompetes, using nationally representative data for 11,500 labor force participants. We show that noncompetes are associated with reductions in employee mobility and changes in the direction of that mobility (i.e., toward noncompetitors) in both states that do and do not enforce noncompetes. Decomposing mobility into job offer generation and acceptance, we detect no evidence of differences in job search, recruitment, or offer activity associated with noncompetes. Rather, we find that employees with noncompetes—even in states that do not enforce them—frequently point to their noncompete as an important reason for declining offers from competitors. Our data further show that these employees’ beliefs about the likelihood of a lawsuit or legal enforcement are important predictors of their citing a noncompete as a factor in their decision to decline competitor offers.},

These effects are far-reaching: increasing enforceability imposes externalities on workers across state borders, suggesting broad effects on labor market dynamism. We show enforceability affects wages by reducing outside options and preventing workers from leveraging tight labor markets to increase earnings. We motivate these findings with a model of search and bargaining. Finally, higher NCA enforceability exacerbates gender and racial earnings gaps.},

Evidence is presented on product and labor market imperfections across manufacturing and services firms in the Netherlands. Price-cost markups and wage markups are both shown to be positively related to intangible intensity at the firm level. A model is developed of the processes of intangible investment and wage bargaining of heterogeneous firms, providing a mechanism that relates workers' tacit knowledge to firm-level product and labor market imperfections. The model also incorporates a role for non-compete agreements (NCAs) limiting worker mobility. Our main empirical contribution comes from using linked employer-employee panel data with information on NCAs and changes in enforceability of these agreements. Using an event-study framework, we demonstrate that the removal of NCAs leads to higher wages and worker mobility, especially for workers in intangible-intensive firms. We find that NCAs affect workers across the skill distribution. The causal findings from changes in the legality of NCAs correspond with the mechanism described in the model.},
